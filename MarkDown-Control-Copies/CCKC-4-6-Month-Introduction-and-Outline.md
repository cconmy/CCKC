# Cyclone County Kennel Club "4-6 Month" Obedience Class


## Welcome to Dog Obedience class with the Cyclone County Kennel Club!
During the next several weeks, we will be helping you teach your dog to be a more desirable pet, companion, and canine citizen. Virtually every dog is trainable to the level we hope you will achieve during this course. How much time and determination you give to training your dog during the course will determine how much you and your dog will benefit. We will do our best to help *YOU* train your dog, but your cooperation with us is the key to your success.


### Aggressive Behavior
Growling, snapping, biting, and other aggressive behavior will NOT be tolerated from any dog.
Aggressive behavior can be embarrassing. We understand this and will suggest ways to help **you** correct any such problems. ***If you are not seriously willing to work with us and stop this behavior, however, you and your dog will be asked to leave. NO REFUNDS!*** We cannot endanger the rest of the class or ourselves.


### Please do the following


#### Feeding
Do not feed your dog on the day of class within 2 hours of class time. A full stomach does not help his/her concentration.


#### Exercise
Exercise your dog well before class, off leash if possible. This allows them to burn up energy so that they can pay better attention to you.


#### Relief
Give your dog plenty of chance to relieve both bowel and bladder before class time. If they relieve themselves here (indoor or outdoor), be a good citizen and use the clean up materials provided. Please do not allow your dog to relieve him or herself close to the front of the building, on the building or on the parked cars.


#### Heat cycles (females)
Please tell one of your instructors if your bitch comes in heat during a class session. You may continue to bring her to class during the time. Be aware there may be some personality changes in her that may change her way of working with you at this time.


Our classes are taught by members of the Cyclone County Kennel Club who donate their time and knowledge to help the public educate their dogs. Many of us compete with our own dogs and have seen many types of training and disciplines. We hope that you will learn from us and get the most out of your class through practice, teamwork, and asking questions! Enjoy this time together with your best friend!


### What you should bring to class

#### Vaccination Record
We **REQUIRE** an up-to-date ***Inoculation Record*** from your veterinarian. Have a copy made for us to keep on file. This is required by state law. DHLP-P is required and Rabies vaccination when given. We also recommend testing for internal parasites through a fecal exam within three weeks of the start of class. Kennel cough vaccine (Bordetella immunization) is a good idea.

#### Leash & Collar
Your puppy's ***buckle collar*** should be well-fitting, good quality leather or nylon. A ***six foot leash*** that separates from the collar is also needed. It should be good quality also, flat leather, nylon, or canvas, **NOT** chain or rope.


#### Training Treats
Bring *Food Treats* for your puppy/dog that are small and soft. Some suggestions: cut-up hot dogs, hard cheese, or semi-moist type of dog or cat treats such as Sausages, Pounce, or Bonkers. These should be easily broken up and easy to gulp down. Cut-up string cheese, cocktail weenies, and commercial training treats are also good. Find out what your puppy loves for training sessions!


##### Your Comfort
Please *wear comfortable clothing* and soft-soled, low-heeled shows. You will be walking around quickly and sitting on the floor. Our building's temperature also fluctuates, so be prepared to shed or add a sweatshirt if need be! Some handlers like fanny packs to carry dog treats in as well. Pockets are great! And don't forget......**Your Puppy!**


##### Keep in mind
Our classes fill up fast! If you are interested in going further with your dog after this class, ask your instructor about other classes. You may wish to call and reserve your space for the next session. Ask your instructor for more information.
