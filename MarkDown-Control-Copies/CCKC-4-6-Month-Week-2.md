# Cyclone County Kennel Club of Ames, Inc. "4-6 Month" Obedience Class


## Second Training Lesson
REPEAT and REVIEW previously taught exercise from last week: Sit-Stay, Watch Me!, Controlled Walking


### ABOUT TURN
With your dog walking next to you, turn to the right, reversing your direction completely. You will probably have to correct the dog with your leash so that he or she turns with you. DO NOT drag or swing the dog around this turn but use several small POPS forward on the leash or your food for encouragement, PRAISING constantly as you do.


### U-TURN
With your dog in heel position, turn to your left to completely change direction. To help your dog through this the first few times, POP back on the leash and step directly in front of them, bumping them with you knee if necessary. Talk to them and PRAISE constantly. Do not stop to wait for them but move briskly and they will learn to keep u.


### LOOK BEHIND YOU, CALL YOUR DOG (beginning the recall)
While heeling your dog at a normal pace, look behind you (to make sure no one or nothing is in your way) and call your dog, taking 4 to 5 quick steps backwards. Make sure to say "(Dog's name), COME!" as you are still moving and give the dog a POP on the leash to help him toward you. Give the command ONCE, then use "happy talk" to encourage (make silly sounds like Boop-Boop or puppypyppy!). PRAISE vigorously AS your puppy comes AND when they get to YOU!


### SIT-STAY WITH DISTRACTIONS
With your dog in heel position, we will gradually begin adding distractions during the SIT-STAY.
This may include obstacles, noises, other people, and dogs in the building.


#### STAY vs. WAIT
Some trainers prefer to use STAY and WAIT as separate commands. STAY is used as a final command that means "stay in that position and location you are in until I release you" whereas WAIT is used as a pause; it is a "freeze" command that will be followed by instruction.


### SUBORDINATION EXERCISES
We will continue throughout the course to practice these exercises:
1. Elevation or Standing Over
2. Inversion
3. Subordinate/Settle position


### GENERAL COMMENTS
Work with your dog daily at least 10 to 15 minutes. Be enthusiastic and use lots of PRAISE! ALWAYS praise your dog for coming to you! NEVER punish a dog after they have come to you, or you are inadvertently punishing the dog for coming to you! If you must discipline the dog, go to them. They will never come willingly and happily to you if they are worried about being punished. If you must administer an unpleasant procedure (medicating, or nail trimming, for example), call them to you, praise, then release. Or, better yet, go to your dog. Also, do not give a command you cannot enforce. If you give a command once, and the dog does not obey, you must be willing to follow through by physically positioning them or using your leash. Until a recall is fully trained, the command should not be used when the dog is off leash.


### SEX TALK
Your instructor will discuss Spaying (for females) and Neutering (for males) and answer any questions you might have about your dog's reproductive health. This discussion is important for responsible dog owners and the pet population.


### Yielding
To train and then live with your dog, there are two thing you need to get from them. One is their love. That's easy - dogs give it freely. The second is their respect. Yielding, because it stimulates precisely one phase of the dog's natural social behavior, gets their respect.
Your dog is a social, pack dwelling animal. Your household is their pack. All pack or herd dwelling animals thrive best within a relatively stable hierarchy of status with some members being more dominant and other assuming a submissive role. Your dog wants to gain as much status within the pack as they possibly can for the simple reason that status bestows "perks". Status within the pack is not achieved by aggression, but by submission, with the lower ranking animal yielding to the higher ranking animal's ritualistic display of authority. Your dog will be a much better pet, as well as a safer pet, if you will do a number of things to keep them from assuming increasingly higher rungs on the dominance ladder.
Pack and herd dwelling animals maintain status in number of ways. One way is control the use of space by other pack members. This week, we are going to start controlling space by teaching your dog to yield to you on command and by your body position. Teaching this also has the added value of allowing you to walk into your home with both arms loaded with packages without having to avoid your dog. We will not use food treats in the teaching of this exercise.
Have your dog
