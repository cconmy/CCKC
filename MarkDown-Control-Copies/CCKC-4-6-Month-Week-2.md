# Cyclone County Kennel Club of Ames, Inc. "4-6 Month" Obedience Class


## Second Training Lesson
REPEAT and REVIEW previously taught exercise from last week: Sit-Stay, Watch Me!, Controlled Walking


### ABOUT TURN
With your dog walking next to you, turn to the right, reversing your direction completely. You will probably have to correct the dog with your leash so that he or she turns with you. DO NOT drag or swing the dog around this turn but use several small POPS forward on the leash or your food for encouragement, PRAISING constantly as you do.


### U-TURN
With your dog in heel position, turn to your left to completely change direction. To help your dog through this the first few times, POP back on the leash and step directly in front of them, bumping them with you knee if necessary. Talk to them and PRAISE constantly. Do not stop to wait for them but move briskly and they will learn to keep u.


### LOOK BEHIND YOU, CALL YOUR DOG (beginning the recall)
While heeling your dog at a normal pace, look behind you (to make sure no one or nothing is in your way) and call your dog, taking 4 to 5 quick steps backwards. Make sure to say "(Dog's name), COME!" as you are still moving and give the dog a POP on the leash to help him toward you.
