# Cyclone County Kennel Club "4-6 Month" Obedience Class


## First Training Lesson


### SIT-STAY
With the dog near you, place your left hand (flat out and palm down) on the dog's hips. Pull up on the collar with your right hand and push down on the hips with your left hand AS you say "SIT".
PRAISE your dog as soon as he or she is in the sit position.
Alternative: Some dogs resist a gentle push or "tap reminder", so sometimes you must "Cup" them into a sit by manually tucking their rear under them.
With your dog sitting in heel position, bring the palm of your hand flat in front of your dog's face while saying "STAY". Count to 5 - DO NOT allow your puppy to leave. Correct with a sharp "NO" and the leash. After you reach 5, release your puppy from the STAY and PRAISE! Gradually increase the length of the stay until he or she can sit for 30 seconds without a correction.


### WATCH ME
With the dog sitting in heel position, look down at him or her and say "WATCH ME!" You may use food, a toy, or just your hand and voice to turn your dog's head towards you at first. When he or she looks up, PRAISE! When your dog looks away remind him or her with your voice and leash to look back. You may have to get down next to the dog at first, then work your way up slowly so they know to look up to you. Practice this in a quiet place until your puppy understands this command. It will be used throughout training to get your dog's mind on YOU and what you two are doing.


### SUBORDINATION
Subordination is a natural process which results in the establishment of a relationship with your dog based on trust and respect. If your puppy learns at an early age that you can handle his or her body in a pleasant, yet powerful way, the chances that he or she will grow up to respect you will be increased. Grooming and other physical care will also be much easier. DO the exercises as practiced in class at least five times a day. Your goal is to have confidence that you can do these exercise anytime and anyplace with your puppy. You can also teach other family members to do these exercises, but we recommend that children do them only under your supervision. A detailed explanation of the exercises is available. Please call and talk with one of us if you or another family member has persistent difficulty practicing these handling exercises; if your puppy becomes more unruly during your subordination sessions this week; if your puppy shows any signs of guarding food, toys, or other objects from you or family members by growling, snapping, or baring their teeth. Remember that subordination exercises are used to teach TRUST and RESPECT - NEVER punish a dog with these exercises!


### SUBORDINATION EXERCISES
We will teach you how to administer them correctly and will practice these exercises:


#### Elevation or Standing Over
Puppy is either held out in front facing you or you stand over, holding them.


#### Inversion
Puppy is on their back, belly up, with head towards you.


#### Subordinate/Settle position
Puppy should be relaxed, not pawing, struggling, mouthing, or growling.

Use verbal correction of a guttural, growling ERRHH and a scruff shake to correct, then immediately praise when relaxed, and gently stroke your puppy. Ask your instructor for help if you are having difficulty with any of these exercises.


### CONTROLLED WALKING
One lesson that your puppy needs to learn to start to become civilized is to walk easily on a loose leash. Dogs who haven't learned this lesson often take their owners for a walk instead of the other way around!

YOUR PUPPY MUST BE ACTIVELY PULLING ON THE LEASH TO LEARN THIS LESSON! If they are not, or if we have instructed you to do so, first use the "alternative method" described later. DO NOT USE THE LEASH POP TECHNIQUE IF YOUR PUPPY "STALLS OUT", BALKS, OR LAGS BEHIND CONTINUALLY.

The first step in teaching your puppy to walk with you is to teach him or her not to pull on the leash. With the 6' leash and buckle collar on your pup, begin by holding the loop of the leash in both hands. Your hands should be fairly close together, palms down, waist high and slightly out from your body. Your elbows should be slightly flexed, and you should feel comfortable and strong! The leash must be at its full length; DO NOT gather it up! Start teaching by giving the verbal signal - "(puppy's name), let's go for a walk!" Your tone of voice should be firm, but happy. If your puppy lunges ahead or to the side, snap briskly on the leash. To be effective, the snap should come just before the leash becomes taut. Use no verbal correction. USE CONTINUOUS, ENTHUSIASTIC HAPPY TALK. The leash provides the teaching action to communicate a wrong choice (pulling, not paying attention) to the puppy. Your voice provides encouragement and reassurance. Your puppy's tail should be up and wagging, and he should be paying attention.
After walking a short distance (approximately 15-20 feet), give your pup a definite release signal, "OKAY!" and drop down on one knee. Offer a treat to reinforce the meaning of "Okay," and reward the completion of the lesson. Then allow your pup a "time out" to play, investigate, or take you for a walk. Your puppy may pull at this time.

You can teach the controlled walking exercise frequently during the week, but remember that your teaching segments should be very short and the "time out" should be relatively long. As you become comfortable with the technique, and your pup gets the idea of walking with you on a loose leash, increase the distance you ask your puppy to walk before taking a break. By next week, the teaching segment should be approximately 2 minutes long, and no more than 10-15% of any walk.


### ALTERNATIVE WALKING METHOD
In order for your teaching relationship with your dog to be a happy one, it's important for your dog to like his leash. Very young, timid, or sensitive dogs or dogs who have no experience with the leash need to be introduced to it gradually.
If your puppy is not used to the leash yet, ask your instructor about this. Getting used to the leash slowly, by first dragging it through the house, then with you holding the end and following (not restraining), and using "happy talk" all the while. Your instructor can also describe how to "Chew-Proof" your leash by using a product such as Bitter Apple or a menthol-based ointment. It may be necessary to sensitize your dog to a foul taste in order to teach them not to chew a treated leash. Ask your instructors how to accomplish this.
DO NOT pop or tug on the leash until your puppy is completely relaxed on the leash and is actively pulling against the restraint of the leash whenever you go for a walk in any location. Never, under any circumstances, pull or drag your puppy against his or her will. If your pup doesn't want to move on his or her own, simply pick him or her up and carry your puppy.
Once your puppy is actively pulling on the leash, you can begin to encourage him or her to walk with you. Holding the leash as instructed in the "controlled Walking" section, kneel down and coax your puppy to you with a happy, enthusiastic voice. As soon as he arrives, reward him or her with a treat, more praise, and plenty of petting. If, at any time during your teaching sessions, your pup shows signs of fearful reluctance, immediately drop down to his or her level and "talk happy" to encourage your pup towards you.
As your puppy learns to follow you, gradually increase the distance that you ask him or her to travel before being rewarded. Begin to increase the distance by getting up and backing away, praising, as he or she comes toward you after you have dropped down.
It is imperative that all teaching sessions be *light-hearted, happy, and brief.* Don't be serious or stern in your teaching, or you may destroy your puppy's enjoyment of working with you and damage your relationship in general.
Once your puppy has overcome his timidity and/or reluctance, you may use the complete "Controlled Walking" procedure. Be very careful with the intensity of your leash snap or pop, as over-correction can cause your puppy to stop trusting you. Sensitive or submissive-type dogs should be trained with a light hand on the leash and extensive verbal praise. If, at any time, your puppy becomes momentarily reluctant or fearful, revert to the "Alternative Procedure" until your puppy's attitude is confident and willing.


### TEACHING "NO" ("Leave it," "off" "stop")
Show your puppy a treat. Then toss the treat gently and playfully on the floor encouraging him or her to get the treat. This is done 3 consecutive times. On the fourth time, the dog is not allowed to get the treat, and a firm but non-threatening "no" is stated stated along with a pop on the leash. This correction is repeated until he/she stops lunging for the treat. You should then release, by excitedly allowing the dog to get the treat along with a release word like "OKAY."


### TEACHING A NEW TRICK
In this course, we ask that you teach a new trick to your pup outside of class. Work over the weeks to develop a performance. You will be asked to demonstrate your trick the last week of class. It does not have to be elaborate or difficult, just different from what we are learning. It can be useful or entertaining, just make sure it's FUN! Use lots of treat and praise as you introduce and train the trick. Be creative and ask an instructor if you are having problems.
