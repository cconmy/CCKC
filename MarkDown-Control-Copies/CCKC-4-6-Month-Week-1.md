# Cyclone County Kennel Club "4-6 Month" Obedience Class


## First Training Lesson


### SIT-STAY
With the dog near you, place your left hand (flat out and palm down) on the dog's hips. Pull up on the collar with your right hand and push down on the hips with your left hand AS you say "SIT".
PRAISE your dog as soon as he or she is in the sit position.
Alternative: Some dogs resist a gentle push or "tap reminder", so sometimes you must "Cup" them into a sit by manually tucking their rear under them.
With your dog sitting in heel position, bring the palm of your hand flat in front of your dog's face while saying "STAY". Count to 5 - DO NOT allow your puppy to leave. Correct with a sharp "NO" and the leash. After you reach 5, release your puppy from the STAY and PRAISE! Gradually increase the length of the stay until he or she can sit for 30 seconds without a correction.


### WATCH ME
With the dog sitting in heel position, look down at him or her and say "WATCH ME!" You may use food, a toy, or just your hand and voice to turn your dog's head towards you at first. When he or she looks up, PRAISE! When your dog looks away remind him or her with your voice and leash to look back. You may have to get down next to the dog at first, then work your way up slowly so they know to look up to you. Practice this in a quiet place until your puppy understands this command. It will be used throughout training to get your dog's mind on YOU and what you two are doing.


### SUBORDINATION
Subordination is a natural process which results in the establishment of a relationship with your dog based on trust and respect. If your puppy learns at an early age that you can handle his or her body in a pleasant, yet powerful way, the chances that he or she will grow up to respect you will be increased. Grooming and other physical care will also be much easier. DO the exercises as practiced in class at least five times a day. Your goal is to have confidence that you can do these exercise anytime and anyplace with your puppy. You can also teach other family members to do these exercises, but we recommend that children do them only under your supervision. A detailed explanation of the exercises is available. Please call and talk with one of us if you or another family member has persistent difficulty practicing these handling exercises; if your puppy becomes more unruly during your subordination sessions this week; if your puppy shows any signs of guarding food, toys, or other objects from you or family members by growling, snapping, or baring their teeth. Remember that subordination exercises are used to teach TRUST and RESPECT - NEVER punish a dog with these exercises!
